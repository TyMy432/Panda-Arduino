# Panda-Arduino
The Panda diffie-hellman key exchange and encryptor, now for use in a linear serial arduino encryptor.


-This software is designed for the arduino due, however it can be used on any arduino with multiple serial ports.

-If an arduino due is being used with a different, 5-volt board, make sure the voltage refferences are set to 3.3 volts to not overload the arduino due.

-This software is inocmplete; the encryption matrix and decryption matrix is not ocmplete. In it's current state it does not run.

-This software is a continuation of Panda, a diffie-hellman key exchage and encryption program designed and written by Graham Pegg.
